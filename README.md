- 👋 Hi, I’m @I-Am-Grogg
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about developing and coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others on projects that will help me improve my skills 
- 📫 How to reach me - see email address on public profile
- ✌️ I hope to learn how to create apps, games, and other programs with the help of those of you who are willing to help me get there
- 💀 I'm brand new. I've taken a python class and I've messed around with appscript
- 💣 While those were fun projects, I'm hoping for something more challenging and involved
